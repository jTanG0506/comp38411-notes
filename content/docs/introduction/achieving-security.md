## Achieving security
### Threat analysis
Before we can put any security measures in place, we first need to identify what assets we wish to protect, the possible vulnerabilities in the system and what threats are posed upon us. To decide what assets to protect, we consider the value of such assets, the threats posed on these assets, their vulnerabilities and likelihood of exploitation. A function equation to calculate risk would be $$Risk = Vulnerability \times Threat \times Cost$$. 

A **cost-benefit analysis** can be carried out to determine whether it is cheaper to prevent the threat, recover from it afterwards or straight out ignore it. Sometimes, it is not cost-beneficial to defeat a threat, as, after all, you would not buy a $$\pounds 50$$ fence to corral a $$\pounds 20$$ horse.

### Policy specification
A **policy specification** is a set of formal statements which identifies possible issues and their scope. Usually accompanied with a policy specification, is a **standard** which assigns quantifiable measures to these issues, a **procedure** which establishes proper steps to take to prevent these threats.

### Security measures
A **security measure** is a method, protocol, tool or procedure used to address risks identified or to enforce a security policy. Security measures can be categorised into one of the following:
- **Prevention**: preventing attacks from happening by closing vulnerabilities, reducing the level of risks, which in turn makes the attack harder, making another target more attractive than this target as bait. Examples of this include access control, firewalls, encryption and digital signatures.
- **Detection**: measures taken during or after the attack. For example, auditing and intrusion detection.
- **Recovery**: stopping the attack, assessing and repairing the damage done and being able to continue to function correctly even if the attack succeeds.
- **Accept** it and do nothing, just smile and move on.

### Operation and maintenance
From time to time, the security implementation should be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the approach. Organisations should check to ensure that they are implementing the policies correctly and that they are following well-established standards.

Examples of maintenance tasks:
- Checking that people have the correct power (in terms of permissions and access to resources) and responsibilities
- Monitoring for new threats; as what was secure yesterday could be vulnerable today
- Evaluating the implementation of security measures in place
- Checking that policies are implemented as intended
- Ensure that security measures follow well-established standards
