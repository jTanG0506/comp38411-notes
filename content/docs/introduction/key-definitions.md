## Key Definitions
- **Confidentiality**: preserving authorised restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorised disclosure of information.
- **Integrity**: guarding against improper information modification or destruction, including ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity. A loss of integrity is the unauthorised modification or destruction of information.
- **Availability**: ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information. A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or an information system.
- **Authenticity**: the property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or message originator. This means verifying that users are whom they say they are and that each input at the system came from a trusted source.
- **Accountability**: the security goal that generates the requirement for actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that entity. This supports non-repudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection and prevention, and after-action recovery and legal action. Because truly secure systems are not yet an achievable goal, we must be able to trace a security breach to a responsible party. Systems must keep records of their activities to permit later forensic analysis to trace security breaches or to aid in transaction disputes.
