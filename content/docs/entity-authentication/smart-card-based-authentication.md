## Smart Card Based Authentication
A smart card is a physical authentication token that is carried around by a user. To prove one's identity as the authorised user of the token, entry of the correct PIN is usually required when the token is used. The PIN provides a second level of security as the smart card is subject to theft. For convenience, PINs are typically short, and to prevent exhaustive search through such a small key space, additional procedural constraints are necessary; for example, incorrect entry of several successive PINs may cause the card to be locked or deactivated.

Smart cards are usually capable of performing simple cryptographic operations, in addition to storing secret information; however, special hardware may be required on every access device, which will require standardisation and can be expensive.
