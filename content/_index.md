# COMP38411

Welcome to my notes for COMP38411 - Cryptography and Network Security (2019 - 2020).

## Save The Koalas üê®
The Australian Red Cross are supporting thousands of people affected by the bushfires and with your support, they can help and support these communities to recover during their time of need. **If you found these notes useful, please consider donating to The Australian Red Cross [here](https://www.redcross.org.au/campaigns/disaster-relief-and-recovery-donate)**.

## Mobile issues
I am aware that the longer LaTeX equations do not render nicely on mobile, I will look into this when I get more time. Alternatively, you can view the site on a desktop browser or use the paper version.

## Alternative formats
These course notes will be available as a paper copy on my [website](https://www.jtang.dev/cryptography-and-network-security). The first three chapters are provided as a PDF [here](https://link.jtang.dev/qawl).

## Other modules
Notes for various Computer Science and Mathematics modules can be found my [website](https://jtang.dev/resources).

## Something not right?
Despite my best efforts, my notes may still contain some errors, if you do spot an error, please [let me know](mailto:notes@jonathantang.dev).
